# Browser test and local fixture infrastructure

This Web task owns the browser project matrix, deterministic local Supabase fixture contract, disposable-account helper and evidence path checks. The fixture data is local-only and uses reserved `.invalid` addresses, fixed UUIDs and a synthetic PNG asset.

## Commands

Run these from `web/`:

```bash
npm run test:e2e -- --list
npm run test:fixtures
npm run test:evidence-paths
```

The E2E project list contains Chromium, Firefox and WebKit. Browser binaries are installed by the developer or CI environment; `--list` only resolves the project matrix and does not require a running application.

To reset a local Supabase database, start Supabase from the repository root and run:

```bash
cd web
npm run reset:fixtures
```

The reset command is fail-closed to the local Supabase CLI and applies `web/fixtures/supabase/seed.sql` with `supabase db reset --local --sql-paths`. It does not accept a linked or remote project. The SQL creates two isolated auth users, two owned books, two owned image records and the local `book-images` bucket; the reset script uploads the synthetic PNG to both fixture storage paths.

Disposable account helpers require `BOOKGOLAS_TEST_SUPABASE_URL` and `BOOKGOLAS_TEST_SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` from the environment. The helper rejects non-local hosts and generates a fresh `.invalid` email and random password for each account. Secrets are never stored in fixtures or committed files.

## Evidence contract

`npm run test:evidence-paths` verifies the task record under `.omo/evidence/bookgolas-web-app-parity/` and the visual capture manifest under `web/docs/evidence/bookgolas-web-app-parity/`. Browser captures may be written to the visual directory by Playwright; `test-results/` remains ignored and disposable.

RED: the three requested commands were absent or incomplete before this task.

GREEN: the commands resolve the three browser projects and validate the deterministic fixture/evidence contracts without credentials.

SURFACE: run the Chromium E2E project with `npm run test:e2e -- --project=chromium`; use Firefox and WebKit in CI or after installing their browser binaries.

CLEANUP: local reset data, disposable accounts and `test-results/` are disposable; no local secret, token or account is committed.
