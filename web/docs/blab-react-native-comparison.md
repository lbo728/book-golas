# BLDS native-to-Web comparison

The Web consumer is pinned to BLDS commit `10a9016f58b30728f179f1c96b0ed738c40c271c` and the public React package `@byungsker/blab-design-system@0.2.0`. The machine-checkable source and comparison contract is in `web/docs/blab-react-parity-contract.json`.

| Native source | Web public export | Web evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `lib/src/theme/app_colors.dart` and `app_typography.dart` | `BLabColors`, `BLabTypography`, CSS variables | `test:blab-parity`, light/dark screenshots |
| `lib/src/widgets/liquid_glass_button.dart` | `BLabButton` through `ConsumerButton` | focus, loading, reduced-motion, and theme assertions |
| `lib/src/widgets/liquid_glass_card.dart` | `BLabCard` through `ConsumerCard` | consumer notice/error and empty surfaces |
| `lib/src/widgets/liquid_glass_text_field.dart` | `BLabTextField` through `ConsumerTextField` | ko/en sign-in fields and accessible labels |
| `docs/design/REACT.md` state guidance | `BLabLoadingState`, `BLabEmptyState`, `BLabErrorState`, `BLabRetryButton` | SSR role contract and browser error/retry surface |

The Web suite captures the consumer route at 390x844 and 1440x900 for ko/en and both BLDS color modes. `BlabThemeSync` follows the browser `prefers-color-scheme` value, so the light/dark cases exercise the real theme path. The native baseline is rendered headlessly from the pinned Flutter package at 390x844 and is stored beside the Web captures as `task-9-5-blab-native-reference-light.png` and `task-9-5-blab-native-reference-dark.png`. The reproducible source fixture is `web/docs/blab-native-reference-test.dart`; copy it into the pinned BLDS checkout and run the command recorded in the parity contract. A locked macOS session still prevents an interactive simulator capture, so the comparison uses the reproducible Flutter golden plus the Web interaction suite.

The product header, book-card composition, route shells, and numeric progress input retain their existing product layout while shared BLDS primitives are migrated. This boundary is recorded in `surface_policy`; #421 owns the remaining shared primitive migration and #453 introduces no new semantic fork.

Native-only capabilities remain outside the Web adapter: iOS widgets, Siri/App Shortcuts, native push categories, camera/OCR, the native share sheet, and RevenueCat subscription billing.
